# emotionClassifier
This project is emotion recognizer using speech. I converted audio files into image and then classify with CNNs which image belong to which emotion. These images are spectrogram. A spectrogram is a visual way of representing the signal strength, or “loudness”, of a signal over time at various frequencies present in a particular waveform.
You have to run data_preparation.py file first to produce train and test dataset then emotion_classifier.py. This project is based on one dataset named "RAVDESS". IN the future more dataset will be added

This is an example of a spectrogram extracted from an audio.
